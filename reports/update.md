Your project update should answer the following questions (note that some are the same as in the proposal):

1) What is the goal of your project; for example, what do you plan to make, and what should it do?  Identify a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.

Our goal of our project is to learn about network programming in C by building a chat application using sockets. As we mentioned in our proposal, our lower bound is building a simple chat application usable by multiple connected clients. However, our stretch goal for this project is an application where multiple clients can not only send messages, but also files such as documents and images as well.

2) What are your learning goals; that is, what do you intend to achieve by working on this project?

As mentioned in our proposal, our learning goals for this project are to use effective software development tools such as Makefiles and libraries, as well as learning more about network programming's concepts such as servers, clients, sockets, communication protocols, and such. Like our “Lisperers” project, we want to use the project as a learning experience, to focus on learning through the development process rather than focusing on the final product. 

3) What have you done to get started?  Have you found the resources you need, do you have a plan to find them, or do you need help?  If you found any resources you think I should add to the list on the class web page, please email them to me.

For the chat application tutorials, we decided on this one as our main resource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNerEo6Lstw&ab_channel=IdiotDeveloper. This has allowed us to take action on coding a multi-user chatroom. However, from here we are also still deciding on our resources for the stretch goal of file transfer features in our chat program, between these few: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d7_G81uews&ab_channel=IdiotDeveloper, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g_nMNJhRVk&ab_channel=ThinkandLearn, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30440188/sending-files-from-client-to-server-using-sockets-in-c, https://idiotdeveloper.com/file-transfer-using-tcp-socket-in-c/, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11952898/c-send-and-receive-file, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F3GBw28Lg&ab_channel=AkNetworks, and https://forgetcode.com/c/1201-file-transfer-using-tcp.

4) What are you working on now?  Describe at least three concrete tasks that you are working on, and identify which members of the team are working on them.  For each one, what is the "definition of done"; that is, what will you produce to demonstrate that the task is done?

Audience: Think of your update as a rough draft of your final report.  Target an external audience that wants to know what you did and why.  More specifically, think about students in future versions of SoftSys who might want to work on a related project.  Also think about people who might look at your online portfolio to see what you know, what you can do, and how well you can communicate.

Submission Mechanics

1) In your project report, you should already have a folder called "reports" that contains a Markdown document called "proposal.md".  Make a copy of "proposal.md" called "update.md"

2) At the top of this document, give your project a meaningful name that at least suggests the topic of the project.  Do not call it "Software Systems Project 1".  List the complete names of all members of the team. 

3) Answer the questions in the Content section, above. Use typesetting features to indicate the organization of the document.  Do not include the questions as part of your document.

4) At the end of the document, include a link to your Trello board and a link to the repository on GitHub.

5) Complete your update, view it on GitHub, and copy the GitHub URL.  Then paste the URL in the submission space below.
