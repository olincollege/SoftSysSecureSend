# SoftSysSecureSend
A Chat Server that sends messages and files using Sockets from Conan McGannon and Daniel Park

## Instructions for Use

1. Run the client and server code on your own device (required due to different network IPs) with the command `make`
2. Run the server by using command `./server 1234` (Number does not matter as long as it is longer than four digits). You should be prompted with a welcome message.
3. On a different terminal, run the client by using the command `./client 1234` (Number should be the same one you used for the server.) You should be prompted to write your name down.
4. You should be able to send messages! See your messages on the terminal you run your server in.
5. You can add another client by opening a new terminal page and doing Step 3 again.
6. Exit the application by pressing `Ctrl+C`
